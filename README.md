# ``BbAppTask``

Task execution utilities with error handling.

## Overview

The BbAppTask library provides convenient utilities for executing asynchronous tasks with built-in error handling and optional failure callbacks. It offers multiple overloaded ``BbAppTask`` functions that wrap Swift's Task API with automatic error logging, optional delay support, and type-safe result handling. This simplifies async/await usage throughout the application while ensuring consistent error management.
